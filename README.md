## Introduction

A portable weather station offers portability, accurate data, and enhanced safety. It can be easily transported to different locations, providing precise and localized forecasts. This helps in decision-making for various activities and sectors. The station's portability enables monitoring of essential parameters, alerting users to potential weather hazards in advance. With measurements of temperature, humidity, thermal sensation, wind speed, wind direction, UV index, rain fall and then you can process the data and analyze it. In this repository, you will find everything about this project.

I developed this project during a course I took while studying abroad in Germany. The goal was to create a portable weather station capable of reliably measuring weather conditions. A key advantage of this device is its portability, allowing users to easily move it to various locations of interest for weather analysis. All collected data is stored on an SD card, enabling users to retrieve and analyze the information after measurements are complete.

The device also creates a local network, allowing users to connect via Wi-Fi and view real-time data when near the station. Currently, the data is only stored on the SD card, which is ideal for remote or rural areas without Wi-Fi connectivity. However, it's possible to implement both SD card storage and real-time data transmission, and I will discuss this further in the repository.

Another purpose of the portable weather station is to facilitate demonstrations and presentations by universities. The fully functional device can be easily transported for public demonstrations, where people can interact with it through the local network. These exhibitions also provide an opportunity to explain how the device works and the benefits of continuous weather monitoring at specific locations.
